# Maze-Bot 🚀

Maze-Bot Navigator is a microcontroller-based robot that autonomously navigates through a maze using sensor feedback and decision-making logic.

## Features ✨
✅ Real-time obstacle detection  
✅ Efficient pathfinding algorithm  
✅ Microcontroller-based control  
✅ Smooth and adaptive movement  

## How It Works ⚙️
The bot uses sensors to detect obstacles and adjusts its path accordingly. The decision-making logic is implemented in **assembly language**, running on **HCS12 microcontroller**.

## Demo 🎥
